The problem is motivated by new technologies in the realm of optical networks. We investigate algorithmic and combinatorial aspects of the problem.",

  abstract="Given an undirected, connected graph, the aim of the minimum branch-node spanning tree problem is to find a spanning tree with the minimum number of nodes of degree larger than 2. The problem is motivated by network design problems where junctions are significantly more expensive than simple end- or through-nodes, and are thus to be avoided. Unfortunately, it is NP-hard to recognize instances that admit an objective value of zero, rendering the search for guaranteed approximation ratios futile.",
